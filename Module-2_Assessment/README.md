#Hangman Game Chicago

###This project contains the code to aa hangman game. The object of the game is to guess the correct word using letters on the keyboard. All the words are associated with the city of Chicago.

###This project was coded for the purpose of the bootcamp developed by Genesis10. It was a very challenging project for someone who did not have much javascript expierence like me, and that is why there are some bugs in it at the beginning of the game. However, it was very useful practice with javascript which I would love to continue.

###The user can begin the game by clicking one of the letters on the keyboard twice. Be careful to set your volume on low, because after the first iteration of the game, both win and lose sound will be played.
